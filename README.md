# Cat Painting Project 🐱🎨

This project was built as part of [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).  
The goal was to use **CSS positioning, gradients, and layering** to recreate a stylized cat illustration entirely with HTML and CSS — no images used.
